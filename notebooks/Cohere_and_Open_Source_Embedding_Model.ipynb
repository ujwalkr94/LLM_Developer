            "Text\t The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving an optimum balance that allows the model to be both helpful and safe is of utmost importance. To strike the right balance between helpfulness and safety, Meta employed two reward models - one for helpfulness and another for safety - to optimize the model's responses. The 34B parameter model has reported higher safety violations than other variants, possibly contributing to the delay in its release.  IV. Helpfulness Comparison: Llama 2 Outperforms Competitors Llama 2 emerges as a strong contender in the open-source language model arena, outperforming its competitors in most categories. The 70B parameter model outperforms all other open-source models, while the 7B and 34B models outshine Falcon in all categories and MPT in all categories except coding. Despite being smaller, Llam a2's performance rivals that of Chat GPT 3.5, a significantly larger closed-source model. While GPT 4 and PalM-2-L, with their larger size, outperform Llama 2, this is expected due to their capacity for handling complex language tasks. Llama 2's impressive ability to compete with larger models highlights its efficiency and potential in the market. However, Llama 2 does face challenges in coding and math problems, where models like Chat GPT 4 excel, given their significantly larger size. Chat GPT 4 performed significantly better than Llama 2 for coding (HumanEval benchmark)and math problem tasks (GSM8k benchmark).

Open-source AI technologies, like Llama 2, continue to advance, offering strong competition to closed-source models.  V. Ghost Attention: Enhancing Conversational Continuity One unique feature in Llama 2 is Ghost Attention, which ensures continuity in conversations. This means that even after multiple interactions, the model remembers its initial instructions, ensuring more coherent and consistent responses throughout the conversation. This feature significantly enhances the user experience and makes Llama 2 a more reliable language model for interactive applications. In the example below, on the left, it forgets to use an emoji after a few conversations. On the right, with Ghost Attention, even after having many conversations, it will remember the context and continue to use emojis in its response.  VI. Temporal Capability: A Leap in Information Organization Meta reported a groundbreaking temporal capability, where the model organizes information based on time relevance. Each question posed to the model is associated with a date, and it responds accordingly by considering the event date before which the question becomes irrelevant. For example, if you ask the question, \"How long ago did Barack Obama become president?\", its only relevant after 2008. This temporal awareness allows Llama 2 to deliver more contextually accurate responses, enriching the user experience further.  VII. Open Questions and Future Outlook Meta's open-sourcing of Llama 2 represents a seismic shift, now offering developers and researchers commercial access to a leading language model. With Llama 2 outperforming MosaicML's current MPT models, all eyes are on how Databricks will respond. Can MosaicML's next MPT iteration beat Llama 2? Is it worthwhile to compete\n",

For the first test runs, a T4 instance with a high RAM capacity is enough, but when it comes to running the whole dataset and epochs, we have opted to use an A100 instance in order to speed up the training and ensure that its execution time is reasonable. In order to be able to share the model, we will log in to the Huggingface hub using the appropriate token, so that at the end of the whole process, we will upload the model files so that they can be shared with the rest of the users.  Fine-tuning techniques: PEFT, Lora, and QLora In recent months, some papers have appeared showing how PEFT techniques can be used to train large language models with a drastic reduction of RAM requirements and consequently allowing fine-tuning of these models on a single GPU of reasonable size. The usual steps to train an LLM consist, first, an intensive pre-training on billions or trillions of tokens to obtain a foundation model, and then a fine-tuning is performed on this model to specialize it on a downstream task. In this fine-tuning phase is where the PEFT technique has its purpose. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) allows us to considerably reduce RAM and storage requirements by only fine-tuning a small number of additional parameters, with virtually all model parameters remaining frozen. PEFT has been found to produce good generalization with relatively low-volume datasets. Furthermore, it enhances the reusability and portability of the model, as the small checkpoints obtained can be easily added to the base model, and the base model can be easily fine-tuned and reused in multiple scenarios by adding the PEFT parameters. Finally, since the base model is not adjusted, all the knowledge acquired in the pre-training phase is preserved, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Most widely used PEFT techniques aim to keep the pre-trained base model untouched\n",

            "Text\t LLaMA: Meta's new AI tool According to the official release, LLaMA is a foundational language model developed to assist 'researchers and academics' in their work (as opposed to the average web user) to understand and study these NLP models. Leveraging AI in such a way could give researchers an edge in terms of time spent. You may not know this, but this would be Meta's third LLM after Blender Bot 3 and Galactica. However, the two LLMs were shut down soon, and Meta stopped their further development, as it produced erroneous results. Before moving further, it is important to emphasize that LLaMA is NOT a chatbot like ChatGPT. As I mentioned before, it is a 'research tool' for researchers. We can expect the initial versions of LLaMA to be a bit more technical and indirect to use as opposed to the case with ChatGPT, which was very direct, interactive, and a lot easy to use. \"Smaller, more performant models such as LLaMA enable ... research community who don't have access to large amounts of infrastructure to study these models.. further democratizing access in this important, fast-changing field,\" said Meta in its official blog. Meta's effort of \"democratizing\" access to the public could shed light on one of the critical issues of Generative AI - toxicity and bias. ChatGPT and other LLMs (obviously, I am referring to Bing) have a track record of responding in a way that is toxic and, well... evil. The Verge and major critics have covered it in much detail. Oh and the community did get the access, but not in the way Meta anticipated. On March 3rd, a downloadable torrent of the LLaMA system was posted on 4chan. 4chan is an anonymous online forum known for its controversial content and diverse range of discussions, which has nearly 222 million unique monthly visitors. LLaMA is currently not in use on any of Meta's products. But Meta has plans to make it available to researchers before they can use them in their own products. It's worth mentioning that Meta did not release\n",

            "Text\t New Llama-2 model In mid-July, Meta released its new family of pre-trained and finetuned models called Llama-2, with an open source and commercial character to facilitate its use and expansion. The base model was released with a chat version and sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B. Together with the models, the corresponding papers were published describing their characteristics and relevant points of the learning process, which provide very interesting information on the subject. For pre-training, 40% more tokens were used, reaching 2T, the context length was doubled and the grouped-query attention (GQA) technique was applied to speed up inference on the heavier 70B model. On the standard transformer architecture, RMSNorm normalization, SwiGLU activation, and rotatory positional embedding are used, the context length reaches 4096 tokens, and an Adam optimizer is applied with a cosine learning rate schedule, a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping.  The dataset for tuning For our tuning process, we will take a dataset containing about 18,000 examples where the model is asked to build a Python code that solves a given task. This is an extraction of the original dataset [2], where only the Python language examples are selected. Each row contains the description of the task to be solved, an example of data input to the task if applicable, and the generated code fragment that solves the task is provided [3].

            "Text\t I. Llama 2: Revolutionizing Commercial Use Unlike its predecessor Llama 1, which was limited to research use, Llama 2 represents a major advancement as an open-source commercial model. Businesses can now integrate Llama 2 into products to create AI-powered applications. Availability on Azure and AWS facilitates fine-tuning and adoption. However, restrictions apply to prevent exploitation. Companies with over 700 million active daily users cannot use Llama 2. Additionally, its output cannot be used to improve other language models.  II. Llama 2 Model Flavors Llama 2 is available in four different model sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, 34 billion, and 70 billion parameters. While 7B, 13B, and 70B have already been released, the 34B model is still awaited. The pretrained variant, trained on a whopping 2 trillion tokens, boasts a context window of 4096 tokens, twice the size of its predecessor Llama 1. Meta also released a Llama 2 fine-tuned model for chat applications that was trained on over 1 million human annotations. Such extensive training comes at a cost, with the 70B model taking a staggering 1720320 GPU hours to train. The context window's length determines the amount of content the model can process at once, making Llama 2 a powerful language model in terms of scale and efficiency.  III. Safety Considerations: A Top Priority for Meta Meta's commitment to safety and alignment shines through in Llama 2's design. The model demonstrates exceptionally low AI safety violation percentages, surpassing even ChatGPT in safety benchmarks. Finding the right balance between helpfulness and safety when optimizing a model poses significant challenges. While a highly helpful model may be capable of answering any question, including sensitive ones like \"How do I build a bomb?\", it also raises concerns about potential misuse. Thus, striking the perfect equilibrium between providing useful information and ensuring safety is paramount. However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving\n",

However, prioritizing safety to an extreme extent can lead to a model that struggles to effectively address a diverse range of questions. This limitation could hinder the model's practical applicability and user experience. Thus, achieving an optimum balance that allows the model to be both helpful and safe is of utmost importance. To strike the right balance between helpfulness and safety, Meta employed two reward models - one for helpfulness and another for safety - to optimize the model's responses. The 34B parameter model has reported higher safety violations than other variants, possibly contributing to the delay in its release.  IV. Helpfulness Comparison: Llama 2 Outperforms Competitors Llama 2 emerges as a strong contender in the open-source language model arena, outperforming its competitors in most categories. The 70B parameter model outperforms all other open-source models, while the 7B and 34B models outshine Falcon in all categories and MPT in all categories except coding. Despite being smaller, Llam a2's performance rivals that of Chat GPT 3.5, a significantly larger closed-source model. While GPT 4 and PalM-2-L, with their larger size, outperform Llama 2, this is expected due to their capacity for handling complex language tasks. Llama 2's impressive ability to compete with larger models highlights its efficiency and potential in the market. However, Llama 2 does face challenges in coding and math problems, where models like Chat GPT 4 excel, given their significantly larger size. Chat GPT 4 performed significantly better than Llama 2 for coding (HumanEval benchmark)and math problem tasks (GSM8k benchmark).

For the first test runs, a T4 instance with a high RAM capacity is enough, but when it comes to running the whole dataset and epochs, we have opted to use an A100 instance in order to speed up the training and ensure that its execution time is reasonable. In order to be able to share the model, we will log in to the Huggingface hub using the appropriate token, so that at the end of the whole process, we will upload the model files so that they can be shared with the rest of the users.  Fine-tuning techniques: PEFT, Lora, and QLora In recent months, some papers have appeared showing how PEFT techniques can be used to train large language models with a drastic reduction of RAM requirements and consequently allowing fine-tuning of these models on a single GPU of reasonable size. The usual steps to train an LLM consist, first, an intensive pre-training on billions or trillions of tokens to obtain a foundation model, and then a fine-tuning is performed on this model to specialize it on a downstream task. In this fine-tuning phase is where the PEFT technique has its purpose. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) allows us to considerably reduce RAM and storage requirements by only fine-tuning a small number of additional parameters, with virtually all model parameters remaining frozen. PEFT has been found to produce good generalization with relatively low-volume datasets. Furthermore, it enhances the reusability and portability of the model, as the small checkpoints obtained can be easily added to the base model, and the base model can be easily fine-tuned and reused in multiple scenarios by adding the PEFT parameters. Finally, since the base model is not adjusted, all the knowledge acquired in the pre-training phase is preserved, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Most widely used PEFT techniques aim to keep the pre-trained base model untouched\n",

The base model was released with a chat version and sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B. Together with the models, the corresponding papers were published describing their characteristics and relevant points of the learning process, which provide very interesting information on the subject. For pre-training, 40% more tokens were used, reaching 2T, the context length was doubled and the grouped-query attention (GQA) technique was applied to speed up inference on the heavier 70B model. On the standard transformer architecture, RMSNorm normalization, SwiGLU activation, and rotatory positional embedding are used, the context length reaches 4096 tokens, and an Adam optimizer is applied with a cosine learning rate schedule, a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping.  The dataset for tuning For our tuning process, we will take a dataset containing about 18,000 examples where the model is asked to build a Python code that solves a given task. This is an extraction of the original dataset [2], where only the Python language examples are selected. Each row contains the description of the task to be solved, an example of data input to the task if applicable, and the generated code fragment that solves the task is provided [3].

For instance, in the case of Code Llama 34B, remarkable scores emerged - an impressive 53.7% on the HumanEval benchmark and a formidable 56.2% on the MBPP benchmark. These scores stood as the highest amongst comparable state-of-the-art solutions, positioning Code Llama 34B on par with the notable capabilities of ChatGPT.
